# This file contains ROS workspace and network profiles. These profiles are
# persistent. Define your own custom profiles as follows:
#
#   For ROS Network Profiles:
#
#     function rosnet_private() {
#       # The ROS network will be private to this local computer only
#       # args: <name> <master uri> <ros ip>
#       _rosnet_helper private http://127.0.0.1:11311 127.0.0.1
#     }
#
#   For ROS Workspace Profiles:
#
#     function rosws_acl() {
#       # args: <name> <workspace directory> <rosnet>
#       # leave <rosnet> empty to use currently selected network profile
#       _rosws_helper acl "$HOME/acl_ws" ""
#     }
#
#   To view current profile:
#
#     $ ros_show
#
#   To deselect a persistent workspace profile:
#
#     $ rosws_none
